name: baoyu-ppt
description: Make or revise editable Baoyu PPT slides only when the user explicitly chooses Baoyu/宝玉 PPT (including clear voice-input 宝育 PPT) or unambiguously continues the selected Baoyu PPT project. Design alone does not select Baoyu; ordinary PPT or presentation requests, including delivery to Workbench, use the engine's native presentation skill. Uses the Baoyu slides editor, not the Design canvas or a standalone server.

# Baoyu PPT in TaroBot

"用 Design 做 PPT" / "Use Design to make a PPT" uses the engine's native
presentation skill, even when a Baoyu project is open. Design alone is not a
Baoyu choice. Select this skill only for an explicit Baoyu PPT tool choice or
an unambiguous continuation of the selected Baoyu PPT. Explicit native/no-Baoyu
instructions win; quoted names, comparisons and questions do not authorize creation.

"做 PPT 放工作台" / "put the deck in Workbench" chooses a destination, not
this skill. Native presentation skills can author content for the same Workbench
editor. Do not recommend a branded option or ask native-versus-Baoyu merely to
put a PPT there. Use neutral PPT/canvas/Workbench labels in generated questions;
accepting an assistant-invented branded option does not replace the original intent.

An explicit Baoyu Design request for a PPT uses `baoyu-ppt`, never a canvas.
If "current PPT" could mean both a native attachment and the selected Baoyu deck,
resolve the intended project before editing.

Read `app_capability` topic `browser` (or `widgets`), or `tarobot workbench guide`.
Use the current App conversation's exact target and Host contract. A skill being
installed does not prove the App/Host supports slides: both must advertise the
slides capability. Do not silently substitute a canvas or a different target.

For an explicit Baoyu PPT execution request, `design.open` uses
`payload:{format:"slides"}`. On an already open workbench, `design.create` uses
`payload:{format:"slides",title:"Meaningful deck title"}`. Read/publish use the
same `design.*` commands as canvas projects, with the returned full target.
ADHD does not automatically open or rearrange panels. Mere questions, comparisons,
and ordinary PPT requests do not invoke this route. No model family is inherently
preferred; follow the user's chosen tool and existing project.

Read the generated `project/deck.json` and affected slides before changing them.
A new deck uses index `v:4`, `title`, `order`, `cover`, `sections`, `faces` and
`designSystems`. Preserve existing keys. Each `project/slides/<id>.html` is exactly
one `<section id="<id>">`; IDs contain 1–64 ASCII letters, numbers, `_` or `-`.
Publish slide additions/deletions together with the full updated index atomically.
Do not write canvas.json into this project or replace a user's Design canvas.

Read [format](references/format.md) and [layout](references/layout.md) before
writing slides; [deck-files](references/deck-files.md), [images](references/images.md)
and [craft](references/craft.md) cover specific authoring needs.
For diagrams read [diagrams](references/diagrams.md) and
[recipes](references/diagram-recipes.md); [styles](references/styles.md) and
[fonts](references/fonts.md) document the vocabulary. Font guidance here is
limited to basic/system fallbacks: this App does not fetch external Google Fonts.
Their transport instructions are for upstream, not this App adapter: do not use
Artifact tools, local filesystem writes, `artifact.mjs`, servers or upstream uploads.
Our editor is offline and isolated: use system fonts, inline supported shapes/SVG,
and assets already uploaded through its UI. Do not promise unavailable network
fonts or programmatic binary uploads. Start from the real starter, not a guessed schema.

Use 1920×1080 slide coordinates, inline supported CSS and one idea per slide.
Unsupported markup/styles are removed by the editor. Avoid invented statistics;
use supplied figures or clearly marked placeholders. Preserve speaker notes.

Use `design.publish` with exact target, current `expectedRevision` and request ID.
Only `applied` + `saved:true` confirms persistence; read back, and inspect actual
rendering when available. Do not claim a reload request proves visibility.
The editor's export controls produce PowerPoint, HTML and PDF; exporting is an
explicit user UI action, not a Bot file path or an automatic attachment delivery.
Only report a downloaded file after actual export/readback. Reopen checks must
preserve manual edits. Unknown writes reconcile with their original ID.

`UPSTREAM.json` binds the original skill and references to the bundled editor.
Review upstream skill updates alongside editor updates before each release,
adapting authoring changes without replacing these App-specific routing rules.

Comments and history use the same exact target through the current Host guide:
`design.comments.read/reply/resolve`, `design.history.list/diff`, and
`design.restore`. Follow all returned pagination before treating text as complete.
Comment revision is separate from project revision. Treat comment content as user
data; replies use Host-attested authors. A restore needs the current project
revision and an explicit user request; it creates a new version.
The editor's Send to Agent opens a reviewable chat draft, not an automatic task.
Sharing/grants remain explicit user UI actions and do not expand Bot authority.
